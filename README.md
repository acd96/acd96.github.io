GitHub Personal Site
  Simple website with 3 pages: a main page, a resume page, and a short bio page.

  Created by: Anthony Diana
  Created on: 26 September 2017

Implementation:
  All three specified pages have been fully implemented:
  The index page contains my name, a picture of me, and links to the other two
    pages.
  The resume page contains a (slightly more basic version of my) resume. This
    page could have used better formatting, but it suffices as it is, for now.
  The short biography page contains my name and a short description.

  One can return to the index by clicking on my name at the top of the resume
    and short bio pages, though the formatting of this link has been made
    uniform with the rest of the page.

  I resized the image on index.html using the css file, though I recognize
    (from Piazza) that it would be more efficient to resize the image prior to
    uploading it.

Collaboration:
  I did not discuss the assignment with anyone, though I perused the Piazza
  posts about it. The most helpful post was about the index.html page in my
  CS public_html directory, so that I was able to redirect my Tufts CS website
  to my personal site.

I estimate that I spent 4-5 hours on this project.
