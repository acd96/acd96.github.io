    <h1><a href="/" class="main">Anthony Diana</a></h1>
    <p>I am currently a senior at Tufts University majoring in Applied
      Mathematics and Classics, and minoring in Economics. At Tufts, I'm also
      a student manager at one of the dining halls, where I work around 20 hours
      per week. After graduating early in February, I plan to work as an
      actuary; I've passed two actuarial exams so far, and I'm scheduled for
      another in November 2017. Outside of class and work, I enjoy playing
      tennis or chess.</p>
